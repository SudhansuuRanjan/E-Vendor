## Idea behind <b>E-Vendor</b>:

During the Covid Crisis around the world especially in India, the lockdown period was a difficult one, and the shops when opened could be 
found with a huge rush which led to disobeying of "The Covid Guidelines".

Thinking about this problem, we introduced the idea of this touchless vending machine(on the initial level for packaged foods only) which uses digital currency for payment purposes thereby reducing the chances of making contact with material surfaces or any other human touches during any purchases especially at places like Sudha Dairy, Amul, Coca-Cola etc. It also saves the customer's time and can be deployed for a 24 hour service unlike present day shops and may prove beneficial in the long run of digital revolution removing the use of physical currency.The idea can also be extended in future for non-packaged food items.

## How our E-Vendor works:

- First login in the E-Vendor console by entering your credentials.
- After completing the first step, go to the product you want to buy,select the product, then proceed to checkout and pay through your registered account.
- Once a product dispatch is successful, the vending machine will produce a beep sound.

## Technical Concept behind E-Vendor:

A server is created on the `NodeMCU`. WebApp has been developed so that the user can put a request of his/her choice which is to be initialised
by the `NodeMCU`.Then with the help of actuators the desired product is selected and ejected out of the vending machine.
