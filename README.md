## Idea behind <b>E-Vendor</b>:

During the Covid Crisis around the world especially in India, the lockdown period was a difficult one, and the shops when opened could be 
found with a huge rush which led to disobeying of "The Covid Guidelines".

Thinking about this problem, we introduced the idea of this touchless vending machine which only uses digital currency for payment purposes thereby reducing the chances of making contact with material surfaces or any other human touches during any purchases.

## Technical Concept behind E-Vendor:

A server is created on the `NodeMCU`. WebApp has been developed so that the user can put a request of his/her choice which is to be initialised
by the `NodeMCU`.Then with the help of actuators the desired product is selected and ejected out of the vending machine.
